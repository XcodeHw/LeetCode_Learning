Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.

If the last word does not exist, return 0.

Note: A word is defined as a character sequence consists of non-space characters only.

Example:

Input: "Hello World"
Output: 5
/******************/

class Solution {
public:
	int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
		//为空时
		int to = s.size() - 1;
		while (to >= 0 && s[to] == ' ') to--;
		if (to<0) return 0;
		int from = to - 1;
		while (from >= 0 && s[from] != ' ') from--;
		return to - from;

	}


};

Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
     

class Solution {
public:
	// (xi + n/xi) / 2xi+1=xi - (xi2 - n) / (2xi) = xi - xi / 2 + n / (2xi) = xi / 2 + n / 2xi = (xi + n/xi) / 2。
	int mySqrt(int x) {
		if (x == 0)return 0;
		double last = 0;
		double res = 1;
		while (res != last) {
			last = res;
			res = (res + x / res) / 2;
		}
		return int(res);
